In Karnataka, the official language for communication is Kannada. The urbanization and technological advancements have made this state a gateway for talent from all across the world. In today’s Bangalore’s population, roughly 47% of the people either don’t know to read Kannada or speak the language. The state being an established province from the olden days have a lot of things in the public mentioned in Kannada starting from signboards, information regarding public transport, Government office hoardings, Government forms and even product details. One of the best solutions to counter the problems faced by the non-native population is to take the help of the most used electronic gadget, a mobile phone. A mobile application that can help people understand Kannada would make life easy for a lot of people. An application with user convenience will help them better. Developing such an application needs the application of the concepts of Image Processing, Machine Learning and other android development softwares. BMSCE Dictionary app is one such app that we are trying to make. The primary goal of this project is to develop an android application which helps the user in getting the meaning of a desired word. In our project we deal with two languages namely English and Kannada. The application should provide the meaning of a desired Kannada word in English and vice versa.
